# NSO Progress Trace formats over NSO versions

The Progress Trace have been around in NSO for a long time and started by logging extended trace messages to the developer log containing the execution duration of individual tasks, useful for determining if things were executing as expected.

It was also added the possibility to export CSV (Comma Separated Values) to have a format more suitable for machines to read.

This table will try to give an overview how the format have evolved over time, as it can be a pain to create scripts that a compatible over the versions. It is not just the columns that have changed. Messages have been added, but also renamed and removed.

The goal is give better insight what NSO is doing and to be compatible with OpenTelemetry.
